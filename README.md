# Swipe Product Management App

This is a comprehensive Android application built with Jetpack Compose that allows users to upload products to an API. It features a modern, multi-screen architecture with a splash screen, a dynamic home dashboard, a list of all public products, and a dedicated screen for user-specific uploads.

The app is built with an offline-first approach, ensuring a seamless user experience even without an internet connection. All user-added products are saved locally, and a robust background process handles uploads to prevent the UI from freezing.
